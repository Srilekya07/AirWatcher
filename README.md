# ðŸŒ¿ AirWatcher, A Real-Time Air Quality Prediction System
"This project develops an AI-powered model using machine learning techniques to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) based on environmental data. It aims to provide accurate forecasts, helping in proactive pollution management and public health awareness."

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project is a Real-Time Air Quality Prediction System that uses machine learning to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on live data. The system fetches real-time air quality data from an external API, processes it, and uses a trained Random Forest regression model to make predictions.
